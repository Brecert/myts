# myts
A stdlib for js based around dangerous ideas and better oop, no more workarounds.

Much the lib will be based on [crystal-lang's](https://crystal-lang.org) stdlib

Most of this will have dangerous implementations, usually by prototyping objects.

The epitome of "don't do this" answers on stackoverflow.

Don't use this library other then for personal use.
